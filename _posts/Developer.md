## Introduction

Before drawing some UI/UX designs or going into development, our team had some chances to learn numerous things such as basic concepts of UI/UX designs and steps to draw UI/UX designs.

## What is Information Architecture?

Information architecture is a kind of map for developers. If you want to build a building, you need a blueprint that tells you the materials needed for the building. To be more specific, constructors need to know where the rooftop or the 3rd floor should be, and the blueprint should explain the hierarchical structure of the equipment. Similarly with that, when developers construct applications or web pages, they need that blueprint to see the hierarchical structure between each page. Through this, we could see the flow of this app/web page.

## What did our team do with IA?

Our team needed to consider every case that the user would experience such as failing the game, going to the menu page, resetting the game, and showing the tutorial page. We needed to use Figma to draw maps filled with pages and strokes. It was kind of hard to consider all the possibilities, but it was fun to challenge myself.

## What is wireframe?

The wireframe is kind of similar to IA since both of them are based on the concept of a blueprint. While IA is showing the hierarchical structure of the application, wireframe shows the actual design and pages that are shown to the users. The wireframe needs to show what kind of icon or image should be placed in a certain position. It is similar, but it is kind of different.

## What did our team do with wireframe?

Our team confirmed the basic structure and details of the application we are building through wireframe. It was hard including details needed for drawing the wireframe. We needed to put in all the details such as animation, icon, images. It was a good chance to detaily analyze things that we needed.

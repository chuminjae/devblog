문제 설명
In an effort to improve her vocabulary, Bessie the cow has obtained a set of four wooden blocks, each one a cube with a letter of the alphabet written on each of its six sides. She is learning how to spell by arranging the blocks in a row so the letters on top of the blocks spell words.

Given the letters on each of Bessie's four blocks, and a list of words she would like to spell, please determine which of words on her list she will be able to spell successfully using the blocks.

입력
The first line of input contains N (1≤N≤10), the number of words that Bessie would like to spell. The next four lines each contain a string with six uppercase letters, representing the letters on the six sides of one of Bessie's blocks. The next N lines contain the N words Bessie would like to spell. Each of these is between 1 and 4 uppercase letters long.

출력
For each word on Bessie's list, output YES if she is able to spell it using the blocks and NO otherwise.

## Code Block

```c++
# include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
bool answer;
bool k[4][26];
bool check[100];
char str[100];

void sr(int a){
    if(str[a] == 0){
        answer = true;
    }
    else{
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
            if(check[i] ==  false){
                if(k[i][str[a] - 'A']){
                    check[i] = true;
                    sr(a+1);
                    check[i] = false;
                }

            }
        }
    }
}



int main(){
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
            cin >> str;
        for(int j = 0; j < 6; j++){
            k[i][str[j] - 'A'] = true;
        }
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        answer = false;
        cin >> str;
        sr(0);
        if(answer ==  true){
            cout << "YES" << "\n";
        }
        else{
            cout << "NO" << "\n";
        }
    }
}

## Introduction

According to WHO (World health organization), more than 55 million people are suffering from dementia, and 10 million new cases are shown every year. Indeed, dementia is easily detected through lots of sources on the internet; however, people who get dementia are concentrated in the older age group, so applications with high accessibility and the low entry barrier are crucial to help elders to prevent and detect dementia. Therefore, I created a small puzzle that would help elders to detect and prevent dementia.üòÄ

## Concept of the Puzzle

My puzzle mainly utilizes the concept of mental rotation and geometry. Rotation and geometry are concepts that people learn during elementary schools. There are several reasons that made me to utilize these concepts. The first reason is to increase the accessibility of the puzzle. As I already mentioned, these concepts are easy enough to welcome everyone to access to the puzzle. The second reason is to increase brain acitivity. The purpose of making this puzzle was to prevent and detect dementia. The system can indeed utilize datas such as used time or speed to analyze the status quo of the player, but the datas itself cannot help players to prevent dementia. However, mental rotation can.ü§ó According to neu-brains, mental rotation helps people to prevent dementia which means that players who play this game could enjoy the game itself and prevent dementia.

## Tutorial of the Puzzle

Now I will talk about how to play this game.

First, players will have the chance to see what kind of format will they be made to choose the answer. For example, players could be made to match pairs, choose correct or not, choose the answer of the multiple choice question.

Second, players will be made to observe the images shown in the question. Players should pay attention to the color of the ball placed at the vertices of each figure and the figure itself, and find out whether the figures are the same when they are rotated at any angle. Players should keep in mind that the clock is running out. A timer is shown, and players will fail if they pass the time limit. In this case, the figure with number 1 is the same as the figure with number 4, and the figure with number 2 is the same as the figure with number 3.

Third, players will choose the correct answer that correlates with the format they have seen in the first step. In this case, players will be made to connect the same figure with a line.

## Extra information

It may seem too easy to figure out the questions because it only utilizes basic concepts: geometry and mental rotation.

However, can you easily find out what figure is the same as the figure shown above? If you are a genius you couldüòùüòõ. However, it is very hard to find it out. Controlling the difficulty of this puzzle is very easy because there are a lot of polygons with an unlimited number of colors. Also, we can place three-dimensional figures to increase the difficulty.

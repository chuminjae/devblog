## Introduction

Puzzles are easily played when people feel bored. Students including me also play puzzles to enhance our creativity and logical thinking. Puzzles are enjoyable by themselves, but they also help players to improve academically. I found a good and an easy puzzle that utilizes basic inequality concepts and the principle of `Sudoku`.  &#128525;

## How to play

Players get to choose numbers from 1 to the grid size. In this case the `grid size` is 4 not 16.

Players can plug in the numbers wherever they want. However, there are some rules. Players need to choose the numbers that are correlating with the inequality symbols.

Also, players should keep in mind that every number should appear exactly once in row and column.

## Wrong Cases

This part was made to show some wrong cases shown during solving the puzzle.

In this case, some numbers are shown red which means that it is incorrect because the numbers are overlapping.

In this case, some numbers and inequality signs are shown red which means that is is incorrect because the numbers are not satisfying the inequality equations.

## Solution

This part was made to show an example of how to solve this puzzle.

This image is an example of the grid that I was made to play. First, players can notice that the most upper part should have a sequence of 1,2,3,4 because this sequence only satisfies the given condition of < < < <.

Now we have 11 blanks left. The blank at second row fourth column should be 2 because the blank at second row thrid column should be smaller than the blank in second row fourth column while number 3 and 4 could not be used since it is overlapping. Then we can notice that the blank of second row third column should be 1, the blank of second row first column should be 4 and the blank of second row fourth column should be 2.

Lastly, by considering the last inequality sign, players can substitue each numbers. However, players should still keep in mind tht the number appears exactly once in each row and column. The answer is shown below.

## Introduction

For the final step we learned the process of establishing the application that our team developed and strategies for promotion and marekting.

## Sales, Marketing, Branding

The ultimate purpose of making an application is to provide service to customers.To do that, people need to know about the existence of this application. Therefore, our team learned basic concepts and examples of sales, marketing, and branding. Sales is just sales. As the word salesman shows, the word sales is used at sections where actual benefits are made. Marketing is kind of a strategy. To effectively achieve the goal, stragies are vital. Similarily, marketing is vital for sales. Branding is kind of making a story of the brand. For example, the brand 'Patagonia' is well known for protecting the nature. They also do lots of activities that show efforts to save the nature. What patagonia is doing is branding. They are making their own story.

## Bootcamp

Finally, our team had a boot camp that required each team member to provide a problem that is seen in the world and the correlating solution. The problem that I have identified is picture storage. Due to covid 19, a lot of students in our team have to send a lot of image files through email. However, emails have limits sending multipe images through email, and it is very hard to find the pictures that I did not took. Therefore, I thought that I could build an application that records the first picture and final picture among the files that we are going to send and classify them as seperate files that fits with the storage limit. This might be hard, but I will make this as soon as possible.

## Resolution

It was a very good and valuable time for me. This experience had gave me detailed description of marketing, design, codes, and startup company.

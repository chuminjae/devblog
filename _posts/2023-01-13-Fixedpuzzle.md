## Introduction

Through discussion, the puzzle that our team decided to make was fixed. The puzzle is a developed version of the original game "whack a mole". In normal situations, the size of the mole does not fluctuate or the speed of the mole does not change as the level goes up. However, this puzzle has the property of fluctuating speed and size of the mole to increase the difficulty.

## Reason for choosing this game

There are reasons that our team chose to develop this game.

- This game has the highest fittest with our clients.
- This game fits the most with the biomarker. The biomarker checks for multiple components including speed and pressure, so this game is effective to utilize this biomarker.
- The variable of this game is easy to control. This means that we could easily increase the difficulty of this game and easily program the puzzle.
- The game is not hard, so the entry barrier is very low chose to develop this game..

## Brainstorming ‚ö°Ô∏è

Based on the discussion, a rule book that introduces all the needed detail for the UI/UX designer and the developer was maded. This rule book introduces how the difficuly changes, the basic setting of the game, basic rule of the game, the pattern of changing scores, parameters needed for the game, and the basic page setting of the game.

## Design ‚úçÔ∏è

Our team had to design the icon of this game. As this game is related with mole, which is the main character of this game, and hammer, which is a tool used to catch the mole, an icon that contained both of the trait was needed. There are some protoype version of the icon of this game that I have designed.

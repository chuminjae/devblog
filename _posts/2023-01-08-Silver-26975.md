문제 설명
Farmer John is planning to open a new university for cows!

There are N (1≤N≤105) cows who could potentially attend this university. Each cow is willing to pay a maximum tuition of ci (1≤ci≤106). Farmer John can set the tuition that all cows must pay to enroll. If this tuition is greater than the maximum a cow is willing to pay, then the cow will not attend the university. Farmer John wants to make the most possible money so he can pay his instructors a fair wage. Please determine how much money he can make, and how much tuition he should charge.

입력
The first line contains N. The second line contains N integers c1,c2,…,cN, where ci is the maximum tuition cow i is willing to pay.

출력
Please output the maximum amount of money Farmer John can make and the optimal tuition he should charge. If there are multiple solutions, output the solution with the smallest optimal tuition.

Note that the large size of integers involved in this problem may require the use of 64-bit integer data types (e.g., a "long" in Java, a "long long" in C/C++).

## Code Block

```c++
# include <bits/stdc++.h>
long long a[100000];
using namespace std;
 int main(){
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    vector <long long> s(n);
    long long k = n;
    long long v;
    for(long long i = 0; i < n; i++){
        cin >> v;
        s[i] = v;
    }
    sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    for(long long i = 0; i < n; i++){
        a[i] = s[i] * (n - i);
    }
    long long mx = a[0];
    for(long long i = 0; i < n; i++){
        mx = max(mx, a[i]);
    }
    for(long long i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if(a[i] == mx){
            cout << a[i] << " " << s[i];
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

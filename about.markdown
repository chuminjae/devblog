Hello! Welcome to my blog. I am a student in Harbin Wanbang school who is very interested in development, algorithm, artifical intelligence, and computer science. In my blog, I will post questions that are translated to english with answer codes to help other people developing their own algorithm skills. Also, I will post Java codes and programs that I have made. Some information about the current IT industry. I hope you enjoy my blog.
